# mroam.github.io 
(changed for 2022: use io instead of com, use https instead of http, default branch is "main")

# user personal page

Experimenting with hosting simple web page on github:  https://mroam.github.io and https://mroam.github.io/weblinks (the weblinks is better.)

(Old link was http :// mroam. github. com /index.html)

(Learned in 2017 about http://rawgit.com which looked like a better way of displaying github pages that have javascript, but it has ceased before 2022.)
