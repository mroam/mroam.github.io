# mroam.github.io (no longer github.com for personal sites)
user personal page

Experimenting with hosting simple web page on github. 

(Learned in 2017 about http://rawgit.com which looked like a better way of displaying github pages that have javascript, but it has ceased before 2022.)

Old link was http :// mroam. github. com /index.html

http://mroam.gitub.io
